- For installation please refer to README.md
- Do a vacuum calculation for your system first and save the wavefunction file WAVECAR by specifying LWAVE = .TRUE. in the INCAR file.
- Start the solvation calculation from the vacuum WAVECAR, specify ISTART = 1 in the INCAR file.
- The solvation parameters are read from the INCAR file.
- In the simplest case the only parameter that need to be set is the solvation flag LSOL = .TRUE.
```
    This corresponds to the default case where the solvent is water with a relative permittivity Îµ = 80.
    Note, The cavitation energy in the solvation model requires a higher resolution than neeed for vacuum calculations. So make sure ENCUT is large enough and also set PREC=Accurate
- The relative permittivity of the solvent can be changed from the default value of 78.4 for water to any value using the INCAR parameter EB_k, e.g. EB_k = 20.
- You can also change the surface tension parameter tau in the INCAR file. For example, to neglect the the cavitation energy contribution, set TAU = 0 in the INCAR file. Note that you may have to increase the cutoff energy to converge the caviation energy because the grid must be fine enough to resolve the cavity surface. 

Examples

    The examples directory contains three examples. The first one is a solvated CO molecule, the second one for a solvated water molecule, and the third one for a solvated PbS(100) surface. The solven in all three cases is water. For the CO and H2O molecules, the input files for both the PBE and the HSE exchange-correlation functional are provided.
